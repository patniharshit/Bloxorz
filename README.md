### Abstract-
A 3d game in which there is a movable cuboidal block. The goal of the player is to make it fall into a square hole. The world consists of square tiles which can be arranged in any manner. The tiles have
to be carved out of a 10 X 10 area The movable block is a cuboid made of 2 cubes stacked on top of each other. The length of the side of the cube is same as that of a tile. The Player wins the game when the block falls through the square hole (the block has to be vertical for it to fall through the hole). If the block falls down the edges then the game ends. The tiles are of 4 types - normal tiles, fragile tiles, bridges and switches. In order for a bridge to be constructed, a switch (in a different loca-tion) needs to be pressed by the movable block. Bridges can have 2 states - open and closed, which can be toggled as per the requirements of the player. It is not necessary to remain on the switch to keep the bridge in its current state. The next kind of tiles - fragile tiles, are marked using different colours. If the block stands up vertically, then the tile breaks. To move on frag- ile tiles, the block should lie horizontally (on the longer side).
